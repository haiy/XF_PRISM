$flst=`ls *.csv`
$for fl in $flst
>do
>    ./fast_mic.sh $fl 3 0.6 15
>done
$

3.use XF_PRISM to select the optimal
feature subset. The file contains parameters
is needed.Here is "par".

$./cal.sh

4.extract the subset from the output files

$python extract_sf.py

This will write all the selected subset to a file named "final_res"
